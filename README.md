# single-page-memegen

Shamelessly stolen from various memegens found in Github, I've only mixed them to obtain this single page memegen

I hate NodeJS, so I've researched how to do it in plain JS.

Thanks to various folks I've hacked together this single-page-memegen for the sake of memes. 

## How to use it

`git clone http://rickroll.click/xawos/single-page-memegen` and open the `index.html`.

Upload your image, edit it and save it locally. There you go.

The `Save` Button doesn't work yet, in the future this page will be just an endpoint for a cluster of Raspberry Pis where the memes will be stored.

A new repo will be created for it, so this one will always be safe-for-work as nothing is retrieved from internet and nothing will leave the browser where it runs

## How to contribute

`git clone http://rickroll.click/xawos/single-page-memegen`, modify it and git push it like a normal [Pull Request](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github)

Ping the owner as well, he probably won't notice otherwise :)
